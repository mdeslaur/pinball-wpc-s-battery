# WPC-S Battery Board

This is a battery board for use on Williams WPC-S pinball machines.
It uses the original mouting holes.

It can either be populated with a 3xAA battery holder, or with one or two
CR2032 battery holders and 1N4148 diodes.

If you do use AA batteries, do no use Alkaline batteries, they leak.
The use of Lithium AA batteries is recommended.
